      <p>Nikola Tesla was an engineer and scientist known
        for designing the alternating-current (AC) electric system, which
        is the predominant electrical system used across the world today.
        He also created the "Tesla coil," which is still used in radio
        technology. </p>

      <p>Throughout his career, Tesla discovered, designed and developed ideas
         for a number of important inventions — most of which were officially
         patented by other inventors — including dynamos (electrical generators
         similar to batteries) and the induction motor. </p>
      <p>He was also a pioneer in the discovery of radar technology, X-ray
        technology, remote control and the rotating magnetic field —
        the basis of most AC machinery. Tesla is most well-known for his
        contributions in AC electricity and for the Tesla coil.</p>
